# Frequently Asked Questions


## 1. My Laptop/Computer is very old and I am concerned that I might not be able to partake as much as I'd ideally like to.

There exist a number of resources to run the tutorials online, and also work on the practical problems for yourself online without having to rely on the computing prowess of your laptop:

1. [**Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com), quite probably the most well-known solution to run JuPyter notebooks online, and not have to concern yourself with mismatched software dependencies as 99.99% of the notebooks run out-of-the-box on Google Colab.
2. [**AWS SageMaker Studio Lab**](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio-lab/) new-ish competitor to Google Colab. Pretty much the same as Google Colab, just running on Amazon Web-Services.
3. [**PaperSpace Gradient**](https://www.paperspace.com/gradient) Hosted JuPyter runtime on the cloud with pre-installed machine learning packages.


## 2. I have a question which is not suitable for the Moodle, who should I contact?

If you have a question, which you feel is unsuitable for Moodle, personal, or you feel unsure and would prefer to rather ask directly, then please send an e-mail to Artur Toshev (artur.toshev@tum.de), and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
