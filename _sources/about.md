# About this Lecture

Welcome to the 3rd edition of the *Introduction to Scientific Machine Learnign for Engineers* in the winter semester 2023/2024! We are looking forward to a hopefully great semester, and to excite as many of you as possible for Scientific Machine Learning.

The course breaks down into an introduction to the topic, followed by 4 core content blocks which are interspersed with practice problems while being supported by JuPyter notebook-based tutorials for the practical application of the learned concepts.
