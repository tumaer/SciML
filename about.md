# About this Lecture

> TL;DR: This course gives an overview of both classic machine learning (linear regression/classification, GMM, SVM, GP) as well as more modern deep learning methods (MLP, CNN, RNN, AE). The only prerequisites are linear algebra and some basics of probability theory. After completing the course, you will know how to choose the appropriate class of supervised/unsupervised learning algorithms, how to train a model, and how to evaluate it.

Welcome to the 4th edition of the *Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning for Engineers* in the winter semester 2024/2025! We look forward to a hopefully great semester and to excite as many of you as possible for **Scientific Machine Learning**.

The course breaks down into an introduction to the topic, followed by the core content ("Lecture"), which is interspersed with practice problems while being supported by JuPyter notebook-based tutorials ("Exercise") for the practical application of the learned concepts.
